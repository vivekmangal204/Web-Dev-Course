------------------Arithmetic Operators
+ -> Addition
- -> Subtraction
* -> Mulitplication
/ -> Division
% -> Remainder
------------------Order of Operators
( ) | rootx x^2 | / or * | + or -
P       E          M D      A  s
Associativity Rule - Left to right
------------------Types of Numbers(integer & float)
Integers
- Whole
    ~ zero
    ~ Natural Numbers
- Negative
1. JS has many problems with float operations.
2. We can use Math.round() to converts floats to integers.
3. Always do money calculation in paisa instead of rupees.
------------------Don't learn Syntax
1. Google : Quick answers to coding problems.
2. MDN : In-depth guides and documentation.

3. chaptGPT: Real-time assistance for coding queries.
4. focus : understand concepts, not just syntax.
------------------Strings
1. Strings hold textual data, anything from a single character to paragraph.
2. Strings can be defined using single quotes ' ', double quotes " ", or backticks ` `. Backticks allow for template literals, which can include variables.
 3. You can combine (concatenate) strings using the + operator. For example, "Hello" + " World" will produce "Hello World".
------------------Type Of Operators
1. Check Type: Tells you the data type of a variable.
2. Syntax: Use it like typeofvariable.
3. Common Types: Returns "number," "string," "boolean,"etc.
