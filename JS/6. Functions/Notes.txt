-------> What are Functions
Define : Blocks of reusable code
DRY Principle : "Don't repeat yourself" It encourages code reusability.
Usage : Organizes code and performs specific tasks.
Naming Rules : Same as variable names : camelCase
Example : "Beta Gas Band kar de"

------> Syntax
function[keyword] greet[function_name](name)
{
    //code
}
greet(name);
//code
1. use function keyword to declare.
2. Follows same rules as variable names.
3. use () to contain parameters.
4. Invoke by using the function name followed by ().
5. Fundamental for code organization and reusability.

------> Return Statement
1. Sends a value back from a function.
2. Eg. "Ek glass paani lao"
3. What can be Returned : Value, Variable, calculation etc.
4. Return ends the function immediately.
